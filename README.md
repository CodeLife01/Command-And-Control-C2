# üéØ Command and Control (C2) Frameworks ‚Äì Learning Series

Welcome to the **Command-And-Control-C2** repository ‚Äî a collection of Markdown-based guides that introduce and walk you through the use of modern **Command and Control (C2)** frameworks used in red teaming, adversary emulation, and advanced cyber operations.

This project is intended for red teamers, ethical hackers, cybersecurity researchers, and students looking to understand the fundamentals and hands-on operations of C2 tools in a safe lab environment.

## üîç What You'll Learn

This repository provides a structured overview and walkthroughs for:

- The fundamentals of **C2 frameworks** and their role in cyber operations
- Setting up and using popular C2 tools such as:
  - **Mythic**
  - **PowerShell Empire**
  - **Sliver**
- Creating and deploying C2 payloads
- Tasking and controlling agents in a controlled environment
- Ethical usage and operational safety best practices

Each topic is covered in a dedicated Markdown file with detailed, step-by-step instructions.

## üß∞ Tools Explored

- **Mythic C2** ‚Äì A modern, extensible C2 framework written in Go & Python
- **PowerShell Empire** ‚Äì A post-exploitation and agent-based framework
- **Sliver C2** ‚Äì A Golang-based cross-platform C2 for adversary simulation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These frameworks are powerful tools used by both red and blue teams. All usage in this repo is for lab-based, ethical research only.

## üõ† Lab Requirements

To follow along, you'll need:

- A virtualization setup (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, or cloud VMs)
- A Linux-based attack machine (Kali Linux or Ubuntu recommended)
- Internet access for framework setup and dependency installation
- Optional: Target Windows VM (for agent deployment and tasking)
